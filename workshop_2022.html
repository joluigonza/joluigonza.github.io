<h1>M@TH Hub Workshop: Overcoming the Computational Complexity of Large Dynamical Systems with Parallel Computations:</h1>
       

<h3>Organizers: Emmanuel Fleurantin (UNC-CH, GMU), Jorge L. Gonzalez (GT), Jason Mireles-James (FAU), Wai-Ting Lam (YU), Molei Tao (GT)</h3>


<h3>
Scientific Committee:
Andrey Shilnikov (GSU), Flavio Fenton (GT), Hannah Choi (GT), Gemma Huguet (UPC),
Christopher K.R.T. Jones (UNC-CH), Evelyn Sander (GMU), Thomas Wanner (GMU), Thomas Redd (NCAT), Maciej Capinski (AGH).
</h3>


<h3>
Prerequisites: Successful completion of one 
course in Linear Algebra and ODE, and basic programming skills (experience with Python, Matlab, Julia, Fortran, or C/C++ would be sufficient), completion of introduction to computational Mathematics course preferred. 
</h3>

<h3>
Timeline for the event - length of the event and when: The program (workshop) will tentatively run from September to December. 
At the end of the workshop a small student conference will hosted by Georgia Tech. 
</h3>   


<h3>
    The program consists of several discussion groups that will collaborate closely to understand complex 
    dynamics while working on different applications. <!--These groups will use similar mathematical tools and
    similar computational technologies such as GPUs. The students will present their progress at the end of
    the program in a student conference hosted by Georgia Tech. The ultimate goal of the initiative is to 
    introduce the students to the field of applied mathematics while using modern methods of computation. 
    Techniques for obtaining rigorous bounds in these computations will also be explored whenever possible. -->
    The program will not be comparable to a coding camp; however, the participants are expected to learn to 
    develop their own software. The participants will begin the workshop by enrolling in an appropriate
    Udemy course focusing on parallel computing in order to learn the basics. The course enrollment fee will
    be fully paid by the program. In addition, the mentors will supervise the progress of the mentees and 
    assign computational exercises utilizing the tools mastered during the Udemy course, building up to the 
    main goal of the project. The workshop will also create a GitHub repository for the participants to share
    their projects at the end of the program. The program offers incentives such as recommendations and a 
    certificate of completion of the program. At the end of the program, participants will have the 
    opportunity to present their progress at a small conference at Georgia Tech. Travel and accommodations 
    will be fully covered by the program. Other activities and discussions involving all the participants of 
    the program will take place virtually. These activities will consist of hands-on presentations, 
    discussions, etc. The intention is that the different groups of students interact periodically. 
    The participants will have the opportunity to engage in group presentations with the goal of polishing 
    their work. 
     
</h3>

<h3>Participation will require a modest but consistent time commitment. The weekly schedule will incorporate the following elements (in person or virtually): </h3>

<ul>
<li>Weekly meetings with the group mentor (1 hour)</li>
<li>Weekly lab work + independent reading (3 hours)</li> 
<li>Monthly group presentations + progress report (1 hour)</li> 
<li>Regular seminar (1 hour), OR</li> 
<li>Monthly invited speakers (1 hour):
    <a href="workshop_2022_calendar.html">Calendar</a>
</li>        
</ul>

<h3>The projects will focus on the following themes: </h3>

<li>Neuroscience : Large-scale simulation of neural networks in the presence of noise. 
    An exploratory study of invariants of large population of neurons using different models. We will explore questions such as: What is the relationship between network dynamics and network topology? </li>

<li>Climate Dynamics : Working on problems involving the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), polar vortex, and atmospheric blocking. 
    Starting with conceptual models then evolving into large-scale simulations with rigorous computations of invariant sets whenever possible. Introduction to rate-induced tipping and the study of different possible regime transitions in low (or high dimensional) climate models. </li>

<li>Celestial Mechanics : Connecting orbits between invariant sets play a fundamental role in the design of low energy transfer missions in the solar system. The James Webb telescopeâ€™s halo orbit near L2 is a timely example. Students will learn to apply ideas from dynamical systems theory to problems in space mission planning. </li>
